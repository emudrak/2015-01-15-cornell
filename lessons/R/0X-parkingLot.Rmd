# From writing Functions
--->

<!--- Skip?
Let's start by defining a function `fahr_to_kelvin` that converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to Kelvin:

```{r}
fahr_to_kelvin <- function(temp) {
    kelvin <- ((temp - 32) * (5/9)) + 273.15
  kelvin
}
```

The definition opens with the name of your new function, which is followed by the call to make it a `function` and a parenthesized list of parameter names. You can have as many input parameters as you would like (but too many might be bad style). The body, or implementation, is surrounded by curly braces `{ }`. In many languages, the body of the function - the statements that are executed when it runs - must be indented, typically using 4 spaces. While this is not a mandatory requirement in R coding, we strongly recommend you to adopt this as good practice.

When we call the function, the values we pass to it are assigned to those variables so that we can use them inside the function. The last line within the function is what R will evaluate as a returning value. Remember that the last line has to be a command that will print to the screen, and not an object definition, otherwise the function will return nothing - it will work, but will provide no output. For example, let's try running our function. Calling our own function is no different from calling any other function:

```{r}
fahr_to_kelvin(32)
paste('boiling point of water:', fahr_to_kelvin(212))
```

We've successfully called the function that we defined, and we have access to the value that we returned. However, it the function was redefined as follows

```{r}
fahr_to_kelvin <- function(temp) {
    kelvin <- ((temp - 32) * (5/9)) + 273.15
}
```

Now typing

```{r}
fahr_to_kelvin(32)
```

Will return nothing.

--> In Python lessons, now would come debugging…
==============================


## Composing Functions

Now that we've seen how to turn Fahrenheit into Kelvin, it's easy to turn Kelvin into Celsius:

```{r}
kelvin_to_celsius <- function(temp) {
    Celsius <- temp - 273.15
	Celsius
}

paste('absolute zero in Celsius:', kelvin_to_celsius(0))
```

What about converting Fahrenheit to Celsius? We could write out the formula, but we don't need to. Instead, we can compose the two functions we have already created:

```{r}
fahr_to_celsius <- function(temp) {
	temp_k <- fahr_to_kelvin(temp)
	result <- kelvin_to_celsius(temp_k)
    result
}

paste('freezing point of water in Celsius:', fahr_to_celsius(32.0))
```

This is our first taste of how larger programs are built: we define basic operations, then combine them in ever-large chunks to get the effect we want. 
Real-life functions will usually be larger than the ones shown here—typically half a dozen to a few dozen lines—but they shouldn't ever be much longer than that, or the next person who reads it won't be able to understand what's going on. __Modular programming__


### Challenges

As we've seen in our print statements, we can use `paste` to concatenate strings, `paste(a, b, sep = "")` is `ab`. __Note__: the `sep` can be an important value to define! What is the default? What can `sep` be?

1. Write a function called `fence` that takes two parameters called `original` and `wrapper` and returns a new string that has the `wrapper` character at the beginning and end of the `original`:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
fence  <-  function(original, wrapper) {
    paste(wrapper, original, wrapper, sep="")
}
```
```
fence('name', '*')
*name*
```

## String splits

If the variable s refers to a string, then we can parse the string into its separate components - each of the characters. Base R has a function called `strsplit` that can be used to break up strings, into smaller chunks. 

```{r}
pangram <- "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
strsplit(pangram, " ")
```
		
The output from strsplit is in a `list`. 
Notice that the unusual first line of strsplit()’s output consists of [[1]]. 
Similar to the way that R displays vectors, [[1]] means that R is showing the first element of a list. 
Lists are extremely important concepts in R; they allow you to combine all kinds of variables.
For example, a list can be made up of many elements, and elements could be vectors, dataframes, or matrices. 

In this example, this list has only a single element. Yes, that’s right: The list has one element, but that element is a vector.

To extract an element from a list, you have to use double square brackets. 
Split your pangram into words, and assign the first element to a new variable called words, using double-square-brackets `[[]]` subsetting, as follows:

```{r}
words <- strsplit(pangram, " ")[[1]]
```

We can then pull out the different words using our indexing, where words[1] is the first element in the vector of words and words [9] would be our last:

```{r}
words[2]
words[9]
```

1. Write a function called `out` that returns a string made up of just the first and last characters of its input. a) Outline the steps you need to take to write this function. Discuss with the person sitting next you. b) Write part of the code, make sure it works. c) Write the next step. d) test your function. e) can your function handle words of different lengths?

```{r}
out <- function(word) {
    letter  <- strsplit(word, "")[[1]]
    abbrev  <- paste(letter[1], letter[length(letter)], sep="")
    abbrev
}

out('helium')
```

__Making our function work with different inputs__. If we want just the last word, but we can't remember how long our sentence is, we can use `length()`

```{r}
length(words)
words[length(words)]
```

__BREAK__

## Explaining the R Environments

Let's take a closer look at what happens when we call `fahr_to_celsius(32)`. To make things clearer, we'll start by putting the initial value 32 in a variable and store the final result in one as well:

```{r}
original <- 32.0
final    <- fahr_to_celsius(original)
```

_Discuss and draw a diagram showing what memory looks like after the first line has been executed. Point to the environment_

When we call `fahr_to_celsius`, R doesn't create the variable temp right away. Instead, it creates a new environment, local to the function, to keep track of the variables defined by `fahr_to_kelvin`. Initially, the environment only holds the value of temp:

Your function has its own environment where variables local to that function are stored (`temp` in this case). Since R is lexically scoped that means that the function's environment has a parent environment which is defined by where the function is defined, the global environment in this case (if it were defined inside of another function then the parent environment would be the env for that function).

When we call `fahr_to_kelvin` inside `fahr_to_celsius`, R creates another local environment to hold `fahr_to_kelvin` variables:

When you call `fahr_to_celsius` and it calls `fahr_to_kelvin` then `fahr_to_kelvin` tries to find the variable `temp`, it first looks in its own environment, but if it does not find it there, then looks in its parent environment which is the global env. 

It does this because there are now two variables in play called `temp`: the parameter to `fahr_to_celsius`, and the parameter to `fahr_to_kelvin`. 
Having two variables with the same name in the same part of the program would be ambiguous, so R (and every other modern programming language) creates a new environment for each function call to keep that function's variables separate from those defined by other functions.

When the call to `fahr_to_kelvi`n returns a value, R throws away `fahr_to_kelvin` stack frame and creates a new variable in the stack frame for `fahr_to_celsius` to hold the temperature in Kelvin:

It then calls `kelvin_to_celsius`, which means it creates an environment to hold that function's variables:

Once again, R throws away that stack frame when `kelvin_to_celsius` is done and creates the variable result in the environment for `fahr_to_celsius`:

Finally, when `fahr_to_celsius` is done, R throws away its environment and puts its result in a new variable called final that lives in the `global environment` we started with:

So we need to be really careful when writing functions that we define the correct inputs. For example, if we had not written our function correctly, if `fahr_to_kelvin` input was `temp2`, then instead of using the `temp` input to the function, it would search the global environment for something else that could be defined. In this case, we would get an answer, but it would be the wrong one. If we had correctly assigned it as `temp`, the value would have been correctly carried through within the function's environment.

The summary of this is that the parent environment (global is the parent of `fahr_to_celsius`, `fahr_to_celsius` is the parent to `fahr_to_kelvin`) is the environment where a function was defined (lexical scoping), the parent frame is the frame/environment from which the function was called (simulated dynamic scoping).

This final environment/stack frame is always there; it holds the variables we defined outside the functions in our code. What it doesn't hold is the variables that were in the various stack frames. If we try to get the value of temp after our functions have finished running, R tells us that there's no such thing:

```{r}
# paste('final value of temp after all function calls:', temp)
```

Why go to all this trouble? Well, here's a function called `range` that calculates the difference between the mininum and maximum values in an array:

```{r}
# help(range) #or ?range
# 
# numbers  <-  1:100
# range(numbers)
```

We might very well use a variable with the same name to hold data:

```{r}
# numRange  <-  range(numbers)
```

Same for the celsius function: 

```{r}
hot = 29
fahr_to_celsius(hot)
```

We don't expect `range` to have the value 20.0 after this function call, so the name diff cannot refer to the same thing inside span as it does in the main body of our program. And yes, we could probably choose a different name than diff in our main program in this case, but we don't want to have to read every line of function that we use to see what variable names its functions use before calling any of those functions, just in case they change the values of our variables.

The big idea here is __encapsulation__, and it's the key to writing correct, comprehensible programs. A function's job is to turn several operations into one so that we can think about a single function call instead of a dozen or a hundred statements each time we want to do something. That only works if functions don't interfere with each other; if they do, we have to pay attention to the details once again, which quickly overloads our short-term memory.

### Challenges

1. We previously wrote functions called `fence` and `out`. Walk your neighbor step-by-step through what happens when we call `abbrev <- out(fence('carbon', '+'))`. Use words or a diagram to explain how the variables change, and how the stack/environment changes. Look at the environment tab in RStudio.

__BREAK__

# Testing and Documenting

Once we start putting things in functions so that we can re-use them, we need to start testing that those functions are working correctly. To see how to do this, let's write a function to center a dataset around a particular value:
	
```{r}
center <- function(data, desired){
	new <- (data - mean(data)) + desired
	new
}
```
	
We could test this on our actual data, but since we don't know what the values ought to be, it will be hard to tell if the result was correct. Instead, let's create a matrix of 0's and then center that around 3. This will make it simple to see if our function is working:

```{r}
z <- matrix(data = 0, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
center(z, 3)
```

That looks right, so let's try center on our real data:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
datamatrix <- matrix(1:1600, 40, 40)
```
```{r}
center(datamatrix, 0)
```

It's hard to tell from the default output whether the result is correct, but there are a few simple tests that will reassure us:

```{r}
paste('original min, mean, and max are:', min(datamatrix), ',', mean(datamatrix), ',', max(datamatrix))
centered <- center(datamatrix, 0)

paste('original min, mean, and max are:', min(centered), ',', mean(centered), ',', max(centered))
```	

That seems almost right: the original mean was about 6.1, so the lower bound from zero is how about -6.1. The mean of the centered data isn't quite zero—we'll explore why not in the challenges—but it's pretty close. We can even go further and check that the standard deviation hasn't changed:

```{r}
paste('std dev before and after:', sd(datamatrix), sd(centered))
```

Those values look the same, but we probably wouldn't notice if they were different in the sixth decimal place. Let's do this instead:

```{r}
paste('difference in standard deviations before and after:', sd(datamatrix) - sd(centered))
```

Sometimes, a very small difference can be detected. This could be due to rounding at very low decimal places or it could be a version issue if using different releases of R on different computers. It's still possible that our function is wrong, but it seems unlikely enough that we should probably get back to doing our analysis. We have one more task first, though: we should write some documentation for our function to remind ourselves later what it's for and how to use it.

The usual way to put documentation in software is to add comments like this:

```{r}
#return a new matrix containing the original data centered around the desired value.
center <- function(data, desired){
    new <- (data - mean(data)) + desired
	new
}
```

There's a better way, though. If we make our notes outside the function, we may not be able to find them quickly when we need them. If we put the notes inside the funciton, then simply typing in the function will give us the notes along with all of the text, so we can remember what we told the computer to do. In other languages, docstrings show up as help, even for functions that you wrote yourself.

```{r}
center <- function(data, desired){
    #return a new matrix containing the original data centered around the desired value.
    new <- (data - mean(data)) + desired
	new
}
```		

This is better because we can now view our function and our message anytime:

```{r}
center
```
# Manipulating Data

In our survey dataset, the species are represented by a 2-letter code (e.g.,
"AB"), however, we would like to include the species name. The correspondance
between the 2 letter code and the names are in the file `species.csv`. In this
file, one column includes the genus and another includes the species. First, we
are going to import this file in memory:

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
species <- read.csv("../../data/biology/species.csv")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
species <- read.csv("data/species.csv")
```

We are then going to use the function `match()` to create a vector that contains
the genus names for all our observations. The function `match()` takes at least
2 arguments: the values to be matched (in our case the 2 letter code from the
`surveys` data frame held in the column `species`), and the table that contains
the values to be matched against (in our case the 2 letter code in the `species`
data frame held in the column `species_id`). The function returns the position
of the matches in the table, and this can be used to retrieve the genus names:

```{r, purl=TRUE}
surveys_spid_index <- match(surveys$species, species$species_id)
surveys_genera <- species$genus[surveys_spid_index]
```

Now that we have our vector of genus names, we can add it as a new column to our
`surveys` object:

```{r, purl=TRUE}
surveys <- cbind(surveys, genus=surveys_genera)
```

### Challenge

Use the same approach to also include the species names in the `surveys` data
frame.

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
## Use the same approach to also include the species names in the
## `surveys` data frame.
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
surveys_species <- species$species[surveys_spid_index]
surveys <- cbind(surveys, species_name=surveys_species)
```

```{r, results='show'}
## and check out the result
head(surveys)
```


The function `str()` provides an overview of the object and the elements it
contains. It is a really useful function when working with large and complex
objects:



### Converting factors

If you need to convert a factor to a character vector, simply use
`as.character(x)`.

Converting a factor to a numeric vector is however a little trickier, and you
have to go via a character vector. Compare:

```{r, purl=TRUE}
f <- factor(c(1, 5, 10, 2))
as.numeric(f)               ## wrong! and there is no warning...
as.numeric(as.character(f)) ## works...
as.numeric(levels(f))[f]    ## The recommended way.
```



### Challenge

The function `table()` tabulates observations and can be used to create
bar plots quickly. For instance:

```{r, results='show', purl=TRUE}
## Question: How can you recreate this plot but by having "control"
## being listed last instead of first?
exprmt <- factor(c("treat1", "treat2", "treat1", "treat3", "treat1", "control",
                   "treat1", "treat2", "treat3"))
table(exprmt)
barplot(table(exprmt))
```

<!---
```{r, purl=FALSE}
exprmt <- factor(exprmt, levels=c("treat1", "treat2", "treat3", "control"))
barplot(table(exprmt))
```
--->

By default, `data.frame` converts (= coerces) columns that contain characters
(i.e., text) into the `factor` data type. Depending on what you want to do with
the data, you may want to keep these columns as `character`. To do so,
`read.csv()` and `read.table()` have an argument called `stringsAsFactors` which
can be set to `FALSE`:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
some_data <- read.csv("data/some_file.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

<!--- talk about colClasses argument?, row names?  --->

You can also create `data.frame` manually with the function `data.frame()`. This
function can also take the argument `stringsAsFactors`. Compare the output of
these examples:

```{r, results='show', purl=TRUE}
example_data <- data.frame(animal=c("dog", "cat", "sea cucumber", "sea urchin"),
                           feel=c("furry", "furry", "squishy", "spiny"),
                           weight=c(45, 8, 1.1, 0.8))
str(example_data)
example_data <- data.frame(animal=c("dog", "cat", "sea cucumber", "sea urchin"),
                           feel=c("furry", "furry", "squishy", "spiny"),
                           weight=c(45, 8, 1.1, 0.8), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
str(example_data)
```

__Point to the differences between character and factor output with str()__


### Challenge

1. There are a few mistakes in this hand crafted `data.frame`, can you spot and
fix them? Don't hesitate to experiment!

   ```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
   ##  There are a few mistakes in this hand crafted `data.frame`,
   ##  can you spot and fix them? Don't hesitate to experiment!
   author_book <- data.frame(author_first=c("Charles", "Ernst", "Theodosius"),
                                author_last=c(Darwin, Mayr, Dobzhansky),
                                year=c(1942, 1970))
   ```

1. Can you predict the class for each of the columns in the following example?

   ```{r, purl=TRUE}
   ## Can you predict the class for each of the columns in the following example?
   ## Check your guesses using `str(country_climate)`. Are they what you expected?
   ##  Why? why not?
   country_climate <- data.frame(country=c("Canada", "Panama", "South Africa", "Australia"),
                                  climate=c("cold", "hot", "temperate", "hot/temperate"),
                                  temperature=c(10, 30, 18, "15"),
                                  north_hemisphere=c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, "FALSE"),
                                  has_kangaroo=c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, 1))
   ```

   Check your guesses using `str(country_climate)`. Are they what you expected?
   Why? Why not? Check your gueses using `str(country_climate)`. Are they what you expected?
   Why? Why not?

## The R syntax

_Start by showing an example of a script_

* Point to the different parts:
  - a function
  - the assignment operator `<-`
  - the `=` for arguments
  - the comments `#` and how they are used to document function and its content
  - the `$` operator
* Point to indentation and consistency in spacing to improve clarity

![Example of a simple R script](img/r_starting_example_script.png)



## Commenting

Use `#` signs to comment. Comment liberally in your R scripts. Anything to the
right of a `#` is ignored by R.

## Assignment operator

`<-` is the assignment operator. Assigns values on the right to objects on the
left, it is like an arrow that points from the value to the object. Mostly
similar to `=` but not always. Learn to use `<-` as it is good programming
practice. Using `=` in place of `<-` can lead to issues down the line.

In RStudio, typing `Alt + -` (push `Alt`, the key next to your space bar at the
same time as the `-` key) will write ` <- ` in a single keystroke.

`=` should only be used to specify the values of arguments in functions for
instance `read.csv(file="data/some_data.csv")`.

## Allowable object names
Objects can be given any name such as `x`, `current_temperature`, or
`subject_id`. You want your object names to be explicit and not too long. They
cannot start with a number (`2x` is not valid but `x2` is). R is case sensitive
(e.g., `weight_kg` is different from `Weight_kg`). There are some names that
cannot be used because they represent the names of fundamental functions in R
(e.g., `if`, `else`, `for`, see
[here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html)
for a complete list). In general, even if it's allowed, it's best to not use
other function names (e.g., `c`, `T`, `mean`, `data`, `df`, `weights`). In doubt
check the help to see if the name is already in use. It's also best to avoid
dots (`.`) within a variable name as in `my.dataset`. It is also recommended to
use nouns for variable names, and verbs for function names.

## Functions and their arguments

Let's look at a simple function call:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
surveys <- read.csv(file="data/surveys.csv")
```

The `file=` part inside the parentheses is called an argument, and most
functions use arguments. Arguments modify the behavior of the
function. Typically, they take some input (e.g., some data, an object) and other
options to change what the function will return, or how to treat the data
provided.

Most functions can take several arguments, but most are specified by default so
you don't have to enter them. To see these default values, you can either type
`args(read.csv)` or look at the help for this function (e.g., `?read.csv`).

```{r, results='show'}
args(read.csv)
```

If you provide the arguments in the exact same order as they are defined you
don't have to name them:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
read.csv(file="data/surveys.csv", header=TRUE) # is identical to:
read.csv("data/surveys.csv", TRUE)
```

However, it's usually not recommended practice because it's a lot of remembering
to do, and if you share your code with others that includes less known functions
it makes your code difficult to read. (It's however OK to not include the names
of the arguments for basic functions like `mean`, `min`, etc...)

Another advantage of naming arguments, is that the order doesn't matter:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
read.csv(file="data/surveys.csv", header=TRUE) # is identical to:
read.csv(header=TRUE, file="data/surveys.csv")
```


## Good practices

There are two main ways of interacting with R: using the console or by using
script files (plain text files that contain your code).

The recommended approach when working on a data analysis project is dubbed "the
source code is real". The objects you are creating should be seen as disposable
as they are the direct realization of your code. Every object in your analysis
can be recreated from your code, and all steps are documented. Therefore, it is
best to enter as little commands as possible in the R console. Instead, all code
should be written in script files, and evaluated from there. That is where
RStudio is really useful as it makes the passing of code between your script and
the R console easy. The R console should be used to inspect objects, test a
function or get help. With this approach, the `.Rhistory` file automatically
created during your session should not be very useful.

Similarly, you should separate the original data (raw data) from intermediate
datasets that you may create for the need of a particular analysis. For
instance, you may want to create a `data/` directory within your working
directory that stores the raw data, and have a `data_output/` directory for
intermediate datasets and a `figure_output/` directory for the plots you will
generate.

## Seeking help

### I know the name of the function I want to use, but I'm not sure how to use it

If you need help with a specific function, let's say `barplot()`, you can type:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?barplot
```

If you just need to remind yourself of the names of the arguments, you can use:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
args(lm)
```

If the function is part of a package that is installed on your computer but
don't remember which one, you can type:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
??geom_point
```

### I want to use a function that does X, there must be a function or it but I don't know which one...

If you are looking for a function to do a particular task, you can use
`help.search()` (but only looks through the installed packages):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
help.search("kruskal")
```

If you can't find what you are looking for, you can use the
[rdocumention.org](http://www.rdocumentation.org) website that search through
the help files across all packages available.

### I am stuck... I get an error message that I don't understand

Start by googling the error message. However, this doesn't always work very well
because often, package developers rely on the error catching provided by R. You
end up with general error messages that might not be very helpful to diagnose a
problem (e.g. "subscript out of bounds").

However, you should check stackoverflow. Search using the `[r]` tag. Most
questions have already been answered, but the challenge is to use the right
words in the search to find the answers:
[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)

The [Introduction to R](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf) can
also be dense for people with little programming experience but it is a good
place to understand the underpinnings of the R language.

The [R FAQ](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html) is dense and technical
but it is full of useful information.

### Asking for help

The key to get help from someone is for them to grasp your problem rapidly. You
should make it as easy as possible to pinpoint where the issue might be.

Try to use the correct words to describe your problem. For instance, a package
is not the same thing as a library. Most people will understand what you meant,
but others have really strong feelings about the difference in meaning. The key
point is that it can make things confusing for people trying to help you. Be as
precise as possible when describing your problem

If possible, try to reduce what doesn't work to a simple reproducible
example. If you can reproduce the problem using a very small `data.frame`
instead of your 50,000 rows and 10,000 columns one, provide the small one with
the description of your problem. When appropriate, try to generalize what you
are doing so even people who are not in your field can understand the question.

To share an object with someone else, if it's relatively small, you can use the
function `dput()`, it will output R code that can be used to recreate the exact same
object as the one in memory:

```{r, results='show'}
dput(head(iris)) # iris is an example data.frame that comes with R
```

If the object is larger, provide either the raw file (i.e., your CSV file) with
your script up to the point of the error (and after removing everything that is
not relevant to your issue). Alternatively, in particular if your questions is
not related to a `data.frame`, you can save any R object to a file:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
saveRDS(iris, file="/tmp/iris.rds")
```

The content of this file is however not human readable and cannot be posted
directly on stackoverflow. It can how be sent to someone by email who can read
it with this command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
some_data <- readRDS(file="~/Downloads/iris.rds")
```

Last, but certainly not least, **always include the output of `sessionInfo()`**
as it provides critical information about your platform, the versions of R and
the packages that you are using, and other information that can be very helpful
to understand your problem.

```{r, results='show'}
sessionInfo()
```

### Where to ask for help?

* Your friendly colleagues: if you know someone with more experience than you,
  they might be able and willing to help you.
* Stackoverlow: if your question hasn't been answered before and is well
  crafted, chances are you will get an answer in less than 5 min.
* The [R-help](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help): it is read by a
  lot of people (including most of the R core team), a lot of people post to it,
  but the tone can be pretty dry, and it is not always very welcoming to new
  users. If your question is valid, you are likely to get an answer very fast
  but don't expect that it will come with smiley faces. Also, here more than
  everywhere else, be sure to use correct vocabulary (otherwise you might get an
  answer pointing to the misuse of your words rather than answering your
  question). You will also have more success if your question is about a base
  function rather than a specific package.
* If your question is about a specific package, see if there is a mailing list
  for it. Usually it's included in the DESCRIPTION file of the package that can
  be accessed using `packageDescription("name-of-package")`. You may also want
  to try to email the author of the package directly.
* There are also some topic-specific mailing lists (GIS, phylogenetics, etc...),
  the complete list is [here](http://www.r-project.org/mail.html).
