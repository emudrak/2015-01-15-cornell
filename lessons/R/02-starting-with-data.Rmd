# Presentation of the Survey Data


We are studying the species and weight of animals caught in plots in our study
area.  The dataset is stored as a `.csv` file: 
each row holds information for a
single animal
columns represent:  

* `survey_id` 
* `month`
* `day`
* `year`
* `plot`
* `species` (a 2 letter code, see the species.csv file for
correspondance)
* `sex` ("M" for males and "F" for females)
* `wgt` (the weight in grams).

To get the data in a place that R can find it: 

* [download the data file](https://github.com/datacarpentry/datacarpentry/raw/master/data/biology/surveys.csv)
* put it in directory `"data"` within your working directory for these exercises
* open it in Excel to see what it looks like
 

To load our survey data, we need to locate the `surveys.csv` file. We will use
`read.csv()` to load into memory (as a `data.frame`) the content of the CSV
file.


```{r, eval=FALSE,  purl=FALSE}
surveys <- read.csv('data/surveys.csv')
```

<!--- this chunk if for internal use so code in this lesson can be evaluated --->
```{r, echo=FALSE}
surveys <- read.csv('../../data/biology/surveys.csv')
```

__At this point, make sure all participants have the data loaded__

This statement doesn't produce any output because assignment doesn't display
anything. If we want to check that our data has been loaded, we can print the
variable's value: `surveys`

Wow... that was a lot of output. At least it means the data loaded
properly. Let's check the top (the first 6 lines) of this `data.frame` using the
function `head()`:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
head(surveys)
```

Let's now check the __str__ucture of this `data.frame` in more details with the
function `str()`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
str(surveys)
```
The first line tells us that we have `r nrow(surveys)` observations of `r ncol(surveys)` variables. 
We also see the data types for each of the columns in our data.frame.  
You can also see this information in the *Environment tab* if you click the blue arrow button to unfold this information: 


![a data.frame in the Environment tab](img/r_data.frame_in_EnvirTab.png)

If you want to view the data, click on the grid icon on the right hand side of the line with `surveys` on it. This will open a new tab in the scripts area. You can scroll around, but you cannot edit. 

*NOTE:* Values that were blank in the CSV are now listed as `NA`. This is what R uses for missing data ("not available").

# What are data frames?

`data.frame` is the _de facto_ data structure for most tabular data and what we
use for statistics and plotting.

A `data.frame` is a collection of vectors of identical lengths. Each vector
represents a column, and each vector can be of a different data type (e.g.,
characters, integers, factors). The `str()` function is useful to inspect the
data types of the columns.

A `data.frame` can be created by the functions `read.csv()` or `read.table()`, in
other words, when importing spreadsheets from your hard drive (or the web).


   R coerces (when possible) to the data type that is the least common
   denominator and the easiest to coerce to.


# Inspecting `data.frame` objects

We already saw how the functions `head()` and `str()` can be useful to check the
content and the structure of a `data.frame`. Here is a non-exhaustive list of
functions to get a sense of the content/structure of the data.

* Size:
    * `dim()` - returns a vector with the number of rows in the first element, and
    the number of columns as the second element (the __dim__ensions of the object)
    * `nrow()` - returns the number of rows
    * `ncol()` - returns the number of columns
* Content:
    * `head()` - shows the first 6 rows
    * `tail()` - shows the last 6 rows
* Names:
    * `names()` - returns the column names (synonym of `colnames()` for `data.frame`
	objects)
   * `rownames()` - returns the row names
* Summary:
   * `str()` - structure of the object and information about the class, length and
	content of  each column
   * `summary()` - summary statistics for each column

Note: most of these functions are "generic", they can be used on other types of
objects besides `data.frame`.



### Challenge

Can you answer the following questions??

* What is the class of the object `surveys`?
* How many rows and how many columns are in this object?
* How many species have been recorded during these surveys?
* What is the range of years over which theis data has been recorded? 
* What is the mean weight of animals recorded? 





As you can see, the columns `species` and `sex` are of a special class called
`factor`. Before we learn more about the `data.frame` class, we are going to
talk about factors. They are very useful but not necessarily intuitive, and
therefore require some attention.


## Factors

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
### Factors
```

Factors are used to represent categorical data. Factors can be ordered or
unordered and are an important class for statistical analysis and for plotting.

Factors are stored as integers, and have labels associated with these unique
integers. This is similar to the way stats programs like JMP or SPSS code the data.  While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are
actually integers under the hood, and you need to be careful when treating them
like strings.

Once created, factors can only contain a pre-defined set values, known as
*levels*. By default, R always sorts *levels* in alphabetical order. For
instance, if you have a factor with 2 levels:

```{r, purl=TRUE}
sex <- factor(c("male", "female", "female", "male"))
sex
```

R will assign `1` to the level `"female"` and `2` to the level `"male"` (because
`f` comes before `m` in the alphabet, even though the first element in this vector is
`"male"`). You can check the names of the levels by using the function `levels()`, and check the
number of levels using `nlevels()`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
levels(sex)
nlevels(sex)
```

Sometimes, the order of the factors does not matter, other times you might want
to specify the order because it is meaningful (e.g., "low", "medium", "high") or
it is required by particular type of analysis. Additionally, specifying the
order of the levels allows to compare levels:

```{r, purl=TRUE, error=TRUE}
food <- factor(c("low", "high", "medium", "high", "low", "medium", "high"))
levels(food)
food <- factor(food, levels=c("low", "medium", "high"))
levels(food)

```

In R's memory, these factors are represented by numbers (1, 2, 3). They are
better than using simple integer labels because factors are self describing:
`"low"`, `"medium"`, and `"high"`" is more descriptive than `1`, `2`, `3`. Which
is low?  You wouldn't be able to tell with just integer data. Factors have this
information built in. It is particularly helpful when there are many levels
(like the species in our example data set).
